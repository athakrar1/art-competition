		<p>Upsilon Pi Epsilon is the international honour society for the Computing Sciences backed by both IEEE and ACM.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>I created it with subdividing a bunch of boxes in Cinema4D Education 2 years ago; now that C4D doesn't have education version, I simply exported my original C4D file to .dae with trial......</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>~6 hours, but long time ago</p>

		<h3>Caption</h3>
		<p>A beautiful cow, lost in space.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>Subdivided the provided cow mesh to make it look a bit smoother, then wrote a vertex and fragment shader in GLSL to make the cow oscillate through rainbow colors and twist around.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>2-3 hours to learn GLSL, 20 minutes to actually write the shaders.</p>

		<p>Dancing Pokemon: In the world of Pokemon, three collage students are giving their first hip-hop show! Lets support them!</p><hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>As huge Pokemon fans, we created a short animation named: Dancing Pokemon, where we animated three pokemons (Lucario and two dragonites) and taught them how to hip hop. We implemented the animation in blender. In terms of the procedures, we first downloaded coarse 3D static meshes (models) from Free 3D (https://free3d.com/3d-models/pokemon) and subdivided them to smooth the mesh edges. Then, we downloaded the animation fbx files from maximo.com (Highly recommended) and did the rigging and parent the animations with the models. Finally, we adjusted the light condition as well as the surface material to make the rendered animation more realistic. We rendered the video using blender and converted it to gif using ffmpeg. Hope you like it! Pokemmmmmon Go!!</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>5 hours learning + 2 hours creating</p>

		<p>Teapot Man. The hero / villain of graphics.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>I modeled the body and monitor head in Autodesk Maya. The teapot was just imported from the project files. Then I modified one of the existing blinn-phong shaders to get the material.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>2 hrs (+ 2 hrs of actually getting the export to work with the project)</p>

		<h3>Caption</h3>
		<p>This is a model of sad Oski crying to reflect our current emotional states.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>We created this model using Blender by using tools such as loop cutting or extruding various edges/faces on the initial default cube. To ensure that certain shapes were sharp enough to distinguish themselves from the model's base (i.e. the ears and the nose), we subdivided the faces of these two areas. After passing this through our project 2 code, we used loop division to make the surface look smoother, and as we pre-subdivided the faces on the ears and nose, they were sharper and more distinguishable rather than being overly smooth. Finally, as post-processing, we took the screenshot of the model, imported into Photoshop, and applied color on top of the model via layers of the blending modes "Color" and "Darken" to demonstrate that this was Oski and that the objects extruding from his eyes were tears.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>

			<p>planty the potted plant</p> <hr>
			<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
			<p>I made the potted plant in Maya, starting from a basic cube and doing various extrusions and reshaping in order to get the final mesh. I then exported this file from Maya, imported into Blender, and exported again (as .dae) in order to run loop subdivision on the mesh using the project 2 implementation.</p> <hr>
			<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
			<p>around 2-3 hours</p>
